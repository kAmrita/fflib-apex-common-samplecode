The aim is to illustrate fullly working sample application to better illustrate the patterns in presentations and articles. You can see a [demo of this application in the Dreamforce 2013 session](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlq46AEAlLI#t=572) I presented. 

**NOTE:** The supporting **Apex Common** library can be found [here](https://github.com/financialforcedev/fflib-apex-common).

Application Enterprise Patterns on Force.com
============================================

Design patterns are an invaluable tool for developers and architects looking to build enterprise solutions. Here are presented some tried and tested enterprise application engineering patterns that have been used in other platforms and languages. We will discuss and illustrate how patterns such as Data Mapper, Service Layer, Unit of Work and of course Model View Controller can be applied to Force.com. Applying these patterns can help manage governed resources (such as DML) better, encourage better separation-of-concerns in your logic and enforce Force.com coding best practices.
